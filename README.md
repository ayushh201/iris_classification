## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project steps include:

1. Loading and exploring the dataset.
2. Visualizing the data.
3. Preprocessing the data.
4. Training a classification model.
5. Evaluating the model.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It includes 150 observations of iris flowers with the following features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Species (target variable)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git
    ```
2. Change to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd iris-classification
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `iris_classification.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially to execute the code.

## Project Structure

- `iris_classification.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing all the required Python packages for the project.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Results

The notebook provides detailed visualizations and model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The final model achieves high accuracy in classifying the iris species.
